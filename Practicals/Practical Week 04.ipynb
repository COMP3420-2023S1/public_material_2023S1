    "# 1. Connect to github classroom\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the assignments in this unit will be managed via GitHub classroom. Please follow these steps to connect:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Follow this invitation link and accept the invitation: https://classroom.github.com/a/Sk3hdgvB\n",
    "2. The link may ask you to sign in to GitHub (if you haven't signed in earlier). If you don't have a GitHub account, you will need to register.\n",
    "3. Once you have logged in with GitHub, you may need to select your email address to associate your GitHub account with your email address (if you haven't done it in a previous COMP3420 activity). If you can't find your email address, please skip this step and contact diego.molla-aliod@mq.edu.au so that he can do the association manually.\n",
    "4. Wait a minute or two, and refresh the browser until it indicates that your assignment repository has been created. Your repository is private to you, and you have administration privileges. Only you and the lecture will have access to it. The repository will be listed under the list of repositories belonging to this offering of COMP3420: https://github.com/orgs/COMP3420-2023S1/repositories\n",
    "5. Your assignment repository will include starter code that you can use for the exercises below. Clone your repository into a folder in your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical has two kinds of exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement functions and upload the implementation to github classroom**. The exercises will have associated automated tests. To run these tests, please commit your changes and push the changes to your repository. This will initiate the automated tests, and you will receive the test results. There are no marks associated with these tests, but they will help you get used to the environment that you will use for the assignments.\n",
    "2. **Analyse the data, train and evaluate image classifiers.** These exercises do not have automated tests but they will help you practice with the kinds of tasks that you will need to do in assignments 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "As training for assignment 2, let's prepare a collection images for processing by a convolutional network.\n",
