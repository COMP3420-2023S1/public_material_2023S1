# Assignment 1 - Python for Computer Vision

*Submission deadline: Friday 10th March 2022, 11:55pm.*

*Assessment weight: 10% of the total unit assessment.*

*Unless a Special Consideration request has been submitted and approved, a 5% penalty (of the total possible mark of the task) will be applied for each day a written report or presentation assessment is not submitted, up until the 7th day (including weekends). After the 7th day, a grade of ‘0’ will be awarded even if the assessment is submitted. The submission time for all uploaded assessments is **11:55 pm**. A 1-hour grace period will be provided to students who experience a technical concern.  For any late submission of time-sensitive tasks, such as scheduled tests/exams, performance assessments/presentations, and/or scheduled practical assessments/labs, please apply for [Special Consideration](https://students.mq.edu.au/study/assessment-exams/special-consideration).*

## Objectives of this assignment

In this assignment you will practice with the use of Python for computer vision. The assignment consists of 5 independent tasks, each of which is worth 2 marks.

**The deadline of this assignment is before census date, so that it can serve as a diagnostic test and you can determine whether you want to remain in the unit or to withdraw without academic penalty.**

This assignment is completed **both** using GitHub Classroom and iLearn.

## Github Classroom

1. Follow this invitation link and accept the invitation: https://classroom.github.com/a/ktIExbUP
2. The link may ask you to sign in to GitHub (if you haven't signed in earlier). If you don't have a GitHub account, you will need to register.
3. Once you have logged in with GitHub, you may need to select your email address to associate your GitHub account with your email address (if you haven't done it in a previous COMP3420 activity). If you can't find your email address, please skip this step and contact diego.molla-aliod@mq.edu.au so that he can do the association manually.
4. Wait a minute or two, and refresh the browser until it indicates that your assignment repository has been created. Your repository is private to you, and you have administration privileges. Only you and the lecture will have access to it. The repository will be listed under the list of repositories belonging to this offering of COMP3420: https://github.com/orgs/COMP3420-2023S1/repositories
5. Your assignment repository will include starter code that you can use for the exercises of this assignment. Clone your repository into a folder in your computer.
6. Use the template that is part of the starter code, file `a1.py`.
7. Commit your changes and push them to the repository. Each time you push to the repository, the tests included in the file `a1_test.py` will run, and you can check the result of the tests a few minutes later (be patient, the tests take a few minutes to complete).

The template `a1.py` also includes [Python doctests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) that will trigger run each time you run `python a1.py`. These tests are the same as the tests implemented in the file `a1_test.py`, which use the [unittest framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

The result of the unittests in `a1_test.py` is for your feedback. After you submit to iLearn (read below), we will run our automated tests on your iLearn submission and compare with the GitHub tests, for backup.

## iLearn

Once your assignment is ready for submission, submit the contents of `a1.test` in iLearn. This will signal us that your assignmen is ready for assessment. 

We will run two types of automated tests on your submission to iLearn: 

- The "basic tests" (5 marks) are identical to the tests implemented in `a1_test.py`, and we will check whether the marks in GitHub classroom and our "basic tests" are identical, for backup.

- The "advanced tests" (5 marks) are of the same kind as the basic tests, but using different data.


## Submission

The submission to iLearn must be a single Python file. Do not submit several files or a zip file since the automarker would not know what to do with your submission. Do not submit a Jupyter notebook.

Note that **the work submitted should be your own work**. You may be tempted to search the Web for Python implementations of the questions asked in this tutorial, or use AI-based automated code generators. Be aware that:

1. If we find out that your work is copied from the Web or from other submissions, or is generated automatically, you may face disciplinary action.
2. Often, trying to adapt work from the web or 
AI code generators may be more difficult than when you try from scratch.
3. The work you find on the web or AI code generators may be wrong or not do exactly what is asked in this assignment.
